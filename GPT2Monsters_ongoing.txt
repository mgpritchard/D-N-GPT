Any spellcaster with a spell cast on it can animate an object it is holding or a random creature it can see within 30 feet of the object.

For example, an animated object held by a humanoid appears to be humanoid armor, but the creature can see the armor. If an animated object is subjected to any effect that turns invisible, the effect on the animated object is dispelled.An animated object that can see a humanoid within 30 feet of it can, with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, force the creature to make a saving throw against its own DC against a spell attack.
